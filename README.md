- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davorluc, a 22 year old CS student from Switzerland. But you can call me Devi.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in (pretty much) everything tech related. Really excited about what the future has to offer :). On top of that I also enjoy sports, especially Football (the european kind), Basketball, and Boxing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about Web Development (mainly React and CSS). All help is greatly appreciated :).
- ðŸ“« I'm not really a fan of social media anymore, so I won't link really anything, since there isn't much to link. You can always reach me over my e-mail: d.lucic4@hotmail.com
